# Advent of Code

<https://adventofcode.com/>

Mostly in JavaScript, with day 3 done in Ruby. I did day 1 in Google Sheets so
that is not included here.

## Running the solutions

JS solutions can be run with:

```
node days/XX/dXXpXX.js
```

Ruby solution can be run with:

```
ruby days/03/d03p0X.rb
```

Obviously you'll need node and/or ruby to do that.

## Tests

Some of the JS is tested in Jest. To run the tests:

```
# first install with:
yarn
# to run the tests:
yarn test
```
